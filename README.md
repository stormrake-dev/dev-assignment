# SR Dev Assignment

This is a small project that hopefully models the type of work you'll be doing at Stormrake. We'll give you time to explore and research, and then ask you to perform a few tasks.

## Use of AI
Co-pilot / Autocomplete is okay but no vibe coding please. i.e., please refrain from using AI-coded solutions.

## Context
This is a front-end, React app with *mocked* backend data. Initially, it shows a table of transactions per account, with an account selector at the top.
Each account is either US-based or AU-based, so either `Amount (USD)` or `Amount (AUD)` will be shown in the table.

## How to run
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
